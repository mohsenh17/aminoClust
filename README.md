🧬 **VQ-VAE Clustering of Amino Acids using Transformer-Based Embeddings**

This project explores unsupervised clustering of amino acids using **Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE)** on top of embeddings extracted from transformer-based protein language models. By leveraging powerful protein representations, this work aims to uncover meaningful groupings of amino acids based on learned biochemical and structural properties.

## 🚀 Features

- [ ] Embedding extraction from transformer-based protein embedders (e.g., ESM, ProtBert, etc.)
- [ ] Discrete latent space modeling using VQ-VAE
- [ ] Unsupervised clustering of amino acids based on learned codebooks
- [ ] Visualizations of embedding spaces and cluster assignments
- [ ] Modular and extensible codebase for experimenting with different embedders and model architectures

## 🧠 Motivation

Traditional amino acid classifications are often based on physicochemical properties. This project takes a data-driven approach by using learned embeddings and VQ-VAE to discover latent groupings without supervision, potentially revealing novel insights.
